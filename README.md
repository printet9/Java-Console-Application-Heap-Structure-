The Patient Priority System is simple Java-based console application designed to help healthcare providers prioritize patients based on the severity of their medical condition. The application uses a heap structure to ensure that the most critical patients are attended to first.
What it can do?1. Add a Patient: Allows users to input a patient's name and severity level (1 = least severe, 10 = most severe).
2. View Highest-Priority Patient: Displays the patient with the most critical condition.
3. Treat a Patient: Removes the highest-priority patient from the queue after treatment.
4. View All Patients: Lists all patients in the queue, sorted by severity.
These features ensure efficient and fair patient management in busy environments, such as hospitals or clinics.
Why this application was made:
This application was created to demonstrate how a heap structure can be applied in real-world scenarios while addressing a community need. Healthcare providers often deal with overwhelming patient loads, and prioritization is essential for saving lives. By using a binary heap to manage patients, the system ensures critical cases are never overlooked.
How it contribute to me and to the community: 
The Patient Priority System can serve as a foundational tool for triage management in healthcare facilities, particularly in emergency rooms. It helps ensure that critical patients receive timely care, potentially saving lives.
This program can be expanded into a more complex hospital management system, but even as a standalone application, it showcases the power of algorithms in improving societal workflows.
